Gemini Nano Banana, officially Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, is Google's cutting-edge AI model for image generation and editing, emphasizing consistency in subjects across modifications. Released in late August 2025, it integrates into the Gemini app, Google AI Studio, and APIs, enabling natural language prompts for tasks like blending photos, multi-turn edits, and style transfers. Its popularity stems from topping LMArena benchmarks, outperforming tools like Midjourney and DALL-E in realism and adherence to prompts. Users praise its speed (seconds per edit) and free access tiers, though paid plans unlock higher limits and resolutions. Watermarks (visible and SynthID) ensure AI transparency. Search volume has exploded post-launch, with viral X posts and tutorials driving engagement\'97e.g., manga creation from pet photos or product mockups.   \
